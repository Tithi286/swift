How to setup and run:

1. The app is based off this tutorial: https://x-team.com/blog/slack-app-step-by-step/
Parts 1 and 2.

2. Install Node.js, the Yarn package manager, Express.js, and ngrok.

3. Git clone. Login to Slack and navigate to "My Apps".

4. Create a .env file. This will hold the verification token under Basic Info->App Credentials
and the access token under Install App.

slack_app_token=...
verification_token=...

Git will ignore the .env file when you push later.

5. From the swift git repo:
Navigate to /src/ner-server/stanford-ner-2018-10-16.
Type the shell script .\ner-server.sh to start the NER server.
You can also just type the java command in the stanford folder.

6. From the git repo:
yarn run dev
And on a separate terminal:
ngrok http 3000
Copy the https address and paste onto the Event Subscriptions section's Request URL:
[url]/api/events
Save changes.

7. Go to Swift workspace. Now when you post a new message in the support channel, the 
message is read, the tagged entities are logged, and the message is reposted in the general channel.
